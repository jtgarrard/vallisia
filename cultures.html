<h2>Nassia</h2>
Nassia has been a powerful presence in Vallisia for a very long time. It has always had a strong connection with the Orthodoxy, and has generally been seen for a century or more as a shining example of what every Orthodox kingdom should aspire to be. However, after the Kohle Revolution of 12 years ago–which appointed the tyrant, Dienes Voeltz, to the throne–it has become a volatile and expansionist military powerhouse, rapidly conquering large swathes of the continent. Voeltz’ campaign was only halted by the combined forces of the coalition armies and his defeat and unconditional surrender is what led to the Kanavsk Peace Conference
<br>
<br>
<h2>Al-Baqta Empire</h2>
While generally interested in the affairs of Vallisia, Al-Baqta usually chooses to remove itself from most of the conflicts outside of its peninsula, content to manage it’s client states and its overseas colonies. Al-Baqta doesn’t field the largest army on the continent, but it was the first nation to fully industrialize, becoming an economic titan of Vallisia. The vast majority of trade passes through Baqti ports, with continental coal and iron flowing into the peninsula, and Baqti made products flowing back to its fellow nations. Their immense wealth allowed them to bankroll most of the other coalition members’ war debt, and keep them fighting. More than anyone else, the Baqti have a vested interest in maintaining balance and peace among the major powers.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Kamnovka</h2>
Kamnovka is the long-time leader of the Yarost League, a collection of independent states that ally themselves under an elected Sovereign. Famously these nations are independently weak, but difficult to conquer because of their combined might and shared cultural identity. It is common knowledge that they have long held ambitions of consolidating the Yarost League into a more formal nation, with power centralized under the Kamnovkan throne. Kamnovka is home to one of the oldest royal families in Vallisia, and almost every monarch on the continent can find Kamnovkan blood in their family tree. Kamnovka has long held influence far outside of their national borders, by putting family members on foreign thrones rather than campaigning against them, but much of that has been lost as Nassia, under Dienes Voeltz, ravaged the continent. Kamnovka was the initial organizer of the Coalition against the Nassian tyrant.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Lodnika</h2>
Until about 2 decades ago, Lodnika was a very minor state in the Yarost League. However, as Al-baqta began growing its wealth and power through industrialization, Lodnika was one of the first to begin the process of industrializing their economy, with many of the southern states of the Yarost League following suit. By around 9 years ago, Lodnika had become an economic leader among the Yarost League, powerful enough to declare itself rival to the Kamnovkan throne itself. In fact, it seemed very likely that upon the Sovereign’s death, Lodnika would take up the crown. However, with Dienes Voeltz campaigns largely pushing south, Lodnika found itself largely on the frontlines, losing several wars against Nassia before the coalition was finally formed, which Lodnika happily joined. Lodnika has long been renowned for the quality of its troops, and it sacrificed more men and equipment to the war than any other nation.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Deargan Commonwealth</h2>
The Deargan Commonwealth was a latecomer to the Coalition war, as they were once considered allies of Nassia and Dienes Voeltz. They are generally mistrusted as their own power has been expanding into Vallisia for a long time. In fact, one of the reasons they joined the coalition was because they attempted to invade Amawa, a Malaean client state, for control of the south seas during the coalition war. Malaea immediately sought aid from Nassia, prompting Dearga to join the coalition. In spite of their dubious intentions, they were inarguably the saviors of the coalition, turning the tides in their favor. They are an incredibly diverse nation culturally, but they are unified around a common religion, being the only Divisionist Dileassian Major Power. While controlling massive swathes of land, they are still seen as old-fashioned and underdeveloped, largely remaining feudalistic and agrarian. Were they ever to fully industrialize, however, none of the other major powers would come close to rivaling them in power.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Malaea</h2>
Malaea is the current ruler of the southern nations, which always seem to be in a fight for dominance. They had every intention of remaining neutral in the coalition war, but when the Deargan Commonwealth declared war to wrest control of Amawa from them, they found themselves already in debt after putting down a Pallidusian uprising, and were forced to seek aid from the only nation willing to send soldiers, Nassia. Malaea was once considered a strong warrior culture, but they have since settled into the role of traders and peacemakers, Buffered by the nearby Yarost League. They are still a formidable force as long as they hold sway over their southern client states, but losing them would likely lead to many questioning their status as a great power.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Bolotsk</h2>
Bolotsk was one of the first nations to fall to Nassia, due to their desirable position along the southern trade routes. Bolotsk was once seen as a powerful trade empire, propped up by its overseas colonies. Their wealth allowed them to hire mercenary soldiers to fight their war for them. There was once a time when Bolotsk and Handel were considered the two greatest powers in the world, with few able to keep up with their colonial power. However, their old fashioned systems based on sea trade has been consistently proven inferior to industrialization, leading them to fall behind giants like Al-Baqta, and even its sister-state in Barsukovka. During the war, all of its colonies have revolted from Bolotsk control, and unless they can regain them, their status as a great power will be over.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Handel</h2>
Handel came under control of Nassia when Dienes Voeltz forcibly placed his younger brother on the throne. Although his brother was killed in the conflict, Voeltz annexed the nation anyway. Handel was once one of two great powers in the world because of its valuable colonial holdings. Only Bolotsk rivaled it in power and wealth, until the colonial trade system was proven an inferior alternative to industrialization. Now, conquered and humiliated, all of its colonies revolted, taking what little power Handel had left. Now, even the country’s subcultures – particularly the reichers – are calling for independence. Handel may not be a country for much longer if it cannot regain some of its wealth and power.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Silfurmark</h2>
Silfurmark is a looming threat that has shadowed over Vallisia for over 4 centuries. It is a foreign culture, with a strange religion holding many historically Dileassian lands. However, they are now well-established, powerful, wealthy and ready to take any opportunity to gain land in Vallisia. Everyone suspects that they helped fund Nassia in the war, but Nassia refuses to admit the fact, and no one dares treat Silfurmark as if they were on the losing side. Whatever is decided in Valissia because of the Peace Conference, a major concern will always be, are Silfumark’s neighbors strong enough to protect the continent from the Silfur Boogeyman?
